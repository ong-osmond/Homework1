# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
>>Assigned semantic tags "header", "section", "aside" and "footer" to divs based on their positionings on the page.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
>>Maintained the sequence of the HTML elements but edited the CSS file to simplify classes.
>>Added the reset.css styling.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
>>Added "alt" and "title" attributes to images.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
>>Maintained the tags "h1" for the Header, "h2" for the Section and "h3" for the Aside.

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
>>Added the <title>Horiseon - Internet Solutions</title> tag.
